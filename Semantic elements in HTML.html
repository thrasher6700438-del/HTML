                <h1>Facts about Dogs</h1>
                <p>
                    Dogs are loyal, intelligent companions evolved from wolves, known for their incredible sense of smell (40x better than
                    humans!), unique nose prints, and ability to learn commands, with some breeds like Basenjis not even barking; they
                    dream, sweat through paws, and can detect human illnesses, making them truly remarkable animals.

                <p>dogs use complex body language, including their posture, ears, and tail wags, to communicate with humans and other dogs.
                Contrary to popular belief, a wagging tail doesn't always indicate happiness; the direction and speed matter.</p>
